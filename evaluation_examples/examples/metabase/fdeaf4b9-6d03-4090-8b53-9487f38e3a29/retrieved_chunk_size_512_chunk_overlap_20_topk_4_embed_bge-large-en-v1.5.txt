Documentation Title:
Working with the Metabase API

Documentation Content:
Add a data source
You can add a new database using the
POST /api/database/
endpoint, and validate that database’s connection details using the
/api/setup/validate
endpoint. Once you’ve connected the database to your Metabase instance, you can rescan the database and update the schema metadata. You can even add our trusty
Sample Database
as a new database to your instance with
POST /api/database/sample_database
.
Here’s an example database creation call for a
Redshift
database.
curl
-s
-X
POST
\
-H
"Content-type: application/json"
\
-H
'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
\
http://localhost:3000/api/database
\
-d
'{
        "engine": "redshift",
        "name": "Redshift",
        "details": {
            "host": "redshift.aws.com",
            "port": "5432",
            "db": "dev",
            "user": "root",
            "password": "password"
        }
    }'
Set up users, groups, and permissions
You can use the
/api/user
endpoints to create, update, and disable users, or the
/api/permissions
endpoints to set up groups or
add users to them
. Here’s an example curl command to create a user:
curl
-s
"http://localhost:3000/api/user"
\
-H
'Content-Type: application/json'
\
-H
'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
\
-d
'{
    "first_name":"Basic",
    "last_name":"Person",
    "email":"basic@somewhere.com",
    "password":"Sup3rS3cure_:}"
}'
Generate reports
In Metabase, “reports” are referred to as
dashboards
. You can interact with dashboards using the
/api/dashboard
endpoint. You can
create a new dashboard
with
POST /api/dashboard/
, and
add a saved question to a dashboard
with [
POST/api/dashboard/:id/cards
].
Useful endpoints
The links in the Endpoint column below will take you to you to the first action available for that endpoint, which alphabetically is usually the DELETE action.

Documentation Title:
Setting up Metabase

Documentation Content:
We won’t be able to connect to your database without it, but you’d like to deal with all of this later, that’s okay: just click
I’ll add my data later
. Metabase comes with a
Sample Database
that you can play around with to get a feel for how Metabase works.
If you’re ready to connect, here’s what you’ll need:
The
hostname
of the server where your database lives
The
port
the database server uses
The
database name
The
username
you use for the database
The
password
you use for the database
If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.
Connect to your database
Now that you have your database info you can connect to your database. Sweet, sweet data at last. Just go ahead and put your info into this form and click
Next
.
For more on connecting to databases, see
Adding and managing databases
.
Usage data preferences
One last quick thing that you’ll have to decide is if it’s okay for us to collect some anonymous info about how you use the product — it helps us make Metabase better. Like the box says:
Metabase never collects anything about your data or question results.
All collection is completely anonymous.
Collection can be turned off at any point in your admin settings.
If you’re ready to start using Metabase, go ahead and click
Next
.
Staying in touch
At this point you are all set and ready to use Metabase. Since we like keeping in touch with our friends we made it easy to sign up for our newsletter (infrequent emails) with a single click!
Once you’re done here simply follow the link to
Take me to Metabase
. And if you decided to skip the newsletter sign-up, it’s cool, we still like you :)
Getting started with Metabase

Save the above code as

, and make it executable:
chmod
+x create_users.sh
Then run:
MB_HOSTNAME
=
localhost
MB_PORT
=
5001 ./create_users.sh
With your metabase-source instance up, and your users created, open up
http://localhost:5001
and sign in as the admin user you created.
